# 📂 Folder Tree Viewer

Here’s an app I coded — it shows all files in a selected folder in a clean **tree format**.  
Originally, I made it while working on my *SnowRunner Save Editor* to help visualize file structures.  
I ended up not using it, but since it might be useful to someone else, here it is.
